** What is this?

A fork of the [[lml2][LML2]] Common Lisp Markup Language that aims to fully
support HTML5.

For the time being only the *HTML5* doctype is supported, i.e.,
besides the =<!DOCTYPE html>= declaration nothing else HTML5 specific
is supported. I aim to gradually introduce support for all the HTML5
new tags and attributtes.

This fork was created from the [[http://packages.debian.org/sid/cl-lml2][Debian unstable]] cl-lml2 package.

To use the HTML5 document type give as first argument to
=html-file-page= the following

#begin_src lisp
 (html-file-page (<other args> :format :html5 <more args>)
#end_src

Besides supporting HTML5 this fork also supports specifying the
encoding through the keyword argument =:encoding= to =html-file-page=.

To declare a *XHTML 1.0 Strict* document you would give:

#begin_src lisp
 (html-file-page (<other args> :format :xhtml-strict :encoding :utf-8
 <more args>) 
#end_src
